# Iron Shell

This is my submission for Godot Wild Jam #68. Iron Shell is a game where you play as a molten turtle with a furnace on its back and you fight robots and smelt their metal into upgrades in the forge in their shell. I started this game jam a bit impulsively, because of that I was about two days late to start. Nevertheless 
I had a wonderful experience and I hope that shows.

# How to Play:

## Controls:
- Move: W -> UP, S -> DOWN, A -> LEFT, D -> RIGHT
- Shoot Sword:  SPACE
- Use Hammer:  Q
- Use Shield:  E
- Enter Shell Forge:  TAB

Upgrading is very important, so when you can, use your copper, iron and gold to upgrade your speed, max health, and weapons, respectively.

## To win the game:
Defeat all robots and the final boss to win the game.

# Thank You

Thank you so much for playing my game, please enjoy!
